Here is the tweet: I find it pretty incredible, that a house brand golf ball from Dicks Sporting Goods has two of the best scores ever in our Ball Lab.
There are golf ball companies who have spent millions of dollars ðŸ’µ on R&D and been making balls for decades that arenâ€™t making a ball as consistent as a Maxfli.
